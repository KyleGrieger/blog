#Badger Loop
I have started working on a project for the University of Wisconsin Madison called [Badger Loop](http://www.badgerloop.com/).  We are developing a prototype for the [Hyperloop](http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop) high speed transit system for a competition being run by [Spacex](http://www.spacex.com/).  I recently read the biography of Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance for an entrepreneurship class I am in and it was extremely interesting.  It is clear that the discoveries happening at Spacex and Tesla are revolutionary and as an engineer, naturally I want to contribute to these discoveries. However, it's not enough just to want to solve hard problems. You have to actually do it.  Joining Badger Loop was not a decision to beef up my resume, but perhaps my greatest opportunity right now to potentially contribute to a body of knowledge that will improve the human condition.  I know this sounds pretty outlandish and like a bit of a stretch but so is having a bunch of barely 20 year olds design and build a pod that goes 800 miles an hour in a vacuum.  

###Beginning Stages
Right now development on the software side of badger loop is still at a high level planning stage.  We want to create a virtual reality experience of the pod infused with live metrics of pod operations.  Also we plan on having a mobile app that lets the user view these metrics along with many other useful features.  This may seem like just added flashiness but the intention is on the right track.  What the Badger Loop team may not have in terms of financial resources and state of the art manufacturing facilities we can make up for by developing a mind blowing user experience. Because lets face it, for the most part, developing software is free!  The idea is to get the functionality up and running as fast as possible with as little overhead so we can iterate on top of that.  This means getting parts quickly and putting the necessary time into the project. Now, I could be working on planning and getting up to speed on the frameworks and software we are going to be using for the app, but I decided to write a blog post.  And much like the development of the Badger Loop user experience I will be iterating on top of it as the project unfolds.

###Development
Here's were I get into the nitty gritty of what I am doing to contribute to the Badger Loop project.  Now it might not be adventageous to post code samples or lay out exactly how the Badger Loop pod is going to work since the project is for a competition, I will touch on what I have discovered.  I have been tasked with finding sufficient hardware and software for a networking module that will send pod data to a centralized database in real time.  Initially I didn't really have a good idea of where to start so I asked around.  The plan is to have a [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.org/) instance running on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) (Amazon Web Services) to house the data.  Additionally, the idea is to use meteor.js to serve metrics to a web based front end.  On the mobile side, the idea to use [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/) has been tossed around (by me mostly) to limit the overhead of building apps natively for multiple platforms. 

###Challenges
Here I will talk about the challenges I have run into when working on Badger Loop. So far the biggest challenge is figuring out how to deliver a high quality design at low cost with as little overhead as possible.  This can only be achieved by significant research.  Since the Badger Loop team is essentially limited to using consumer electronics it is important we select the parts most suited for our needs.  That being said it, wouldn't be the first time consumer grade parts were included in a project where industrial parts would be preferred.  [Spacex](http://www.spacex.com/) is notorious for doing this in their falcon 9 and falcon heavy rockets. But if the quality is just as good, why pay the steeper price?
