### Welcome to my blog!

I am a senior studying computer science and computer engineering at the Universtiy of Wisconsin Madison.
I have worked at several startups in the Madison area and I have worked on a number of interesting projects.

I decided to start a blog to arcive my thoughts and projects so I can look back and reflect on my work and experieces.

Here goes nothing!
