I am a senior studying computer science and computer engineering at the Universtiy of Wisconsin Madison.
I have worked at several startups in the Madison area and I have worked on a number of interesting projects.

I decided to start a blog to archive my thoughts and projects so I can look back and reflect on my work and experieces.  My posts are usually written in a narrative format in order to make them more interesting to read. 

Enjoy!
